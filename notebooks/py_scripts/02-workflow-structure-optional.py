# # Introduction to the workflow structure
#
# This notebook gives a brief overview of the workflow structure and introduces some useful DataJoint tools to facilitate the exploration.
#
# + DataJoint needs to be pre-configured before running this notebook, if you haven't set up the configuration, refer to notebook [01-configure](01-configure.ipynb).
#
# + If you are familiar with DataJoint and the workflow structure, proceed directly to the next notebook [03-process](03-process.ipynb) to run the workflow.
#
# + For a more thorough introduction of DataJoint functions, please visit our general tutorial site - [DataJoint CodeBook](https://codebook.datajoint.io).
#
# To load the local configuration, we will change the directory to the package root.

import os
os.chdir('..')

# ## Schemas and tables
#
# + The current workflow is composed of multiple database schemas, each of them corresponds to a module within `workflow_miniscope.pipeline`

import datajoint as dj
from workflow_miniscope.pipeline import lab, subject, session, miniscope

# + Each module contains a schema object that enables interaction with the schema in the database.

# + Each module imported above corresponds to one schema inside the database. For example, `ephys` corresponds to `neuro_ephys` schema in the database.
miniscope.schema

# + The table classes in the module corresponds to a table in the schema in the database.

# + Each datajoint table class inside the module corresponds to a table inside the schema. For example, the class `ephys.EphysRecording` correponds to the table `_ephys_recording` in the schema `neuro_ephys` in the database.
# preview columns and contents in a table
miniscope.Processing()

# + The first time importing the modules, empty schemas and tables will be created in the database. [markdown]
# # + By importing the modules for the first time, the schemas and tables will be created inside the database.
#
# # + Once created, importing modules will not create schemas and tables again, but the existing schemas/tables can be accessed and manipulated by the modules.
# + The schemas and tables will not be re-created when importing modules if they have existed. [markdown]
# ## DataJoint tools to explore schemas and tables
#
# # + `dj.list_schemas()`: list all schemas a user has access to in the current database
# + `dj.list_schemas()`: list all schemas a user could access.
dj.list_schemas()

# + `dj.Diagram()`: plot tables and dependencies in a schema. 

# + `dj.Diagram()`: plot tables and dependencies
# plot diagram for all tables in a schema
dj.Diagram(miniscope)

# **Table tiers**: 
#
# + Manual table
#      + Visually represented with a green box.
#      + Manually inserted table
#      + Expect new entries daily, e.g. Subject, Recording.  
# + Lookup table
#      + Visually represented with a gray box.
#      + Pre-inserted table
#      + Commonly used for general facts or parameters. e.g. Strain, ProcessingParamSet.  
# + Imported table
#      + Visually represented with a blue oval.
#      + Auto-processing table
#      + Processing depends on the importing of external files. e.g. `Processing` requires output files from CaImAn.  
# + Computed table
#      + Visually represented with a red circle.
#      + Auto-processing table
#      + Processing does not depend on files external to the database.     
# + Part table
#      + Visually represented with plain text.
#      + As an appendix to the master table, all the part entries of a given master entry represent a intact set of the master entry. e.g. `Mask` of a `Segmentation`.
#
# **Dependencies**:  
#
# + One-to-one primary
#      + Visually represented with a thick solid line.
#      + Share the exact same primary key, meaning the child table inherits all the primary key fields from the parent table as its own primary key.     
# + One-to-many primary
#      + Visually represented with a thin solid line.
#      + Inherit the primary key from the parent table, but have additional field(s) as part of the primary key as well.
# + Secondary dependency
#      + Visually represented with a dashed line.
#      + The child table inherits the primary key fields from parent table as its own secondary attribute.

# + `dj.Diagram()`: plot the diagram of the tables and dependencies. It could be used to plot tables in a schema or selected tables.
# plot diagram of tables in multiple schemas
dj.Diagram(subject) + dj.Diagram(session) + dj.Diagram(miniscope)
# -

# plot diagram of selected tables and schemas
dj.Diagram(subject.Subject) + dj.Diagram(session.Session) + dj.Diagram(miniscope)

# + `heading`: [markdown]
# # + `describe()`: show table definition with foreign key references.
# -
miniscope.Processing.describe();

# + `heading`: show attribute definitions regardless of foreign key references

# + `heading`: show table attributes regardless of foreign key references.

# ## Summary and next step
#
# + This notebook introduced the overall structures of the schemas and tables in the workflow and relevant tools to explore the schema structure and table definitions.
#
# + In the next notebook [03-process](03-process.ipynb), we will introduce the detailed steps to run through the workflow.
